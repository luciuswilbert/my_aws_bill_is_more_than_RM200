Guys, I experienced racism in Malaysia. Somebody called me Ajing. Yeah, and luckily I knew what it meant. I drink means dog, so. I think racism is still there in Malaysia. Like there's some people that are still racist. But then it's OK. It's fine. I'll just clip like a short footage of him saying Ajing. He said something before that, but then I don't know Malay, but then I captured the word anging. You can't make the plastic wet.
